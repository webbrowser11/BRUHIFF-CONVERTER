# 🌀 BRUH Converter

Don’t wanna mess with Rust just to get a `.bruh` file? Use this simple `.exe` PNG-to-BRUH converter instead.

## 🚀 How To Use It

1. **Download the converter**  
   (See the Download + Install section)

2. **Open a Command Prompt**  
   - Go to the folder where `pngtobruh.exe` is located (in File Explorer).
   - Click the **address bar** (where it shows the path like `C:\Users\you\Downloads\`).
   - Type `cmd` and hit **Enter** — this opens a terminal in that folder.

3. **Run the converter**  
   Type the following, replacing the path with your actual PNG file:

   ```bash
   pngtobruh.exe C:\path\to\your\image.png
4. **A '.bruh' file will be created in the same directory as the PNG.**
