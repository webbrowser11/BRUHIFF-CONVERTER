# Known issues
âš  The PNG > BRUH won't work unless you have the same file (i.e. image.png) but with the .bruh extension (i.e. image.bruh). What do you have to do? Create an empty file called `image.bruh`.

1. Preview window width & height are not exact.
2. Huge file size on large images.
3. Slow preview window.
4. Some large images might include `#0` hex which will crash the program.
5. No transparency.
6. Only works on Windows
